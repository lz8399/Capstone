# Team Mahogany

We help first-responders best evaluate terrain risks in post-disaster scenarios by iterating on current drone software/hardware and adding support for harmful radiation detection.

## Getting Started

/docs contains documentation for the capstone project.
/src contains the git repos for the firmware (ardupilot) and high level drone software (Mission Planner).

### Prerequisites

[Install Mission Planner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/common-install-mission-planner.html) before you try to build Mission Planner.

### Building

Build the ardupilot firmware (search for "building pixhawk").

```
http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-the-code.html
```

Build the Mission Planner software.

```
http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/buildin-mission-planner.html
```


## Running the tests

Fill in once we have our own personal tests.

```
No tests to speak of yet...
```

### How to simulate Ardupilot

[Simulate Ardupilot](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/simulation-2.html)

## Deployment

Use Mission Planner to [deploy](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-loading-firmware-onto-pixhawk.html) the firmware to the drone.

## Built With

* [Ardupilot](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot) - Open source drone firmware
* [Mission Planner](https://github.com/ArduPilot/MissionPlanner) - Open source ground control software

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. 

## Authors

This project would have been impossible without the tireless work of the numerous Mission Planner [contributors](https://github.com/ArduPilot/MissionPlanner/graphs/contributors) and the Ardupilot [contributors](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/graphs/contributors).
